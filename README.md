# Machine-learning---Machine-failure
The project focuses on developing and evaluating machine learning models to predict machine failures based on specific input features. The dataset contains a binary classification target variable labeled as "Machine failure". The goal is to build models capable of accurately predicting failures to minimize the risk of undetected critical events.
